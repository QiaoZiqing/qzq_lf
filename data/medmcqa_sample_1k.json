        "output": "Conventional tumour pathology criteria and dna cytometry have limited value in assessing the malignancy of a neuroendocrine tumour. Hence, the detection of substances that are more specific for carcinoid tumours can facilitate a more exact diagnosis. Two markers are primarily used to diagnose and follow carcinoid tumours: 5-hydroxy-indole-acetic acid (5-hiaa) and chromogranin A (CgA). Serotonin released by carcinoid tumours is metabolized by monoamine oxidases in the liver, lungs, and brain to 5-hiaa. When measured in a 24-hour urine sample, 5-hiaa level has a sensitivity of 73% and a specificity of 100% for diagnosing carcinoid . The normal range for urinary 5-hiaa is 3-15 mg/24 h, but the figure may vary depending on the laboratory . Chromogranin A is found in the wall of synaptic vesicles that store serotonin and glucagons. Levels of CgA tend to correlate with tumour bulk but not with symptoms. In general, CgA levels are elevated in 85%-100% of patients with carcinoid tumour, regardless of whether the tumour is functional or nonfunctional. Ref - pubmed.com\nThe answer is A ."

FceRI is expressed on mast cells, basophils, and the antigen-presenting dendritic cells.

CGG codon is repeated 250-4000 times, ie. there are 250-4000 tandem repeates of CGG.Chnomosome mutationo Result from rearrangement of genetic material that give rise to visible structural changes in the chromosome.Genome mutationo Involves loss or gain of whole chromosome, e.g. monosomy - Turner syndrome, trisomy - Down syndrome.\nThe answer is D ."

In this patient, the shifting of the site of maximal cardiac impulse to right side after ET tube inseion and ventilation, suggest that ET tube was wrongly inseed into esophagus instead of trachea. SO the most appropriate next step is to confirm ET tube position and reinse it. Chest X ray cannot differentiate whether ET tube is inseed in trachea or esophagus as esophagus is situated just behind trachea.

The principal classes of xenobiotics of medical relevance are drugs, chemical carcinogens, and various compounds that have found their way into our environment by one route or another, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and ceain insecticides. In phase 1, the major reaction involved is hydroxylation, catalyzed mainly by members of a class of enzymes referred to as monooxygenases or cytochrome P450s. Hydroxylation may terminate the action of a drug, though this is not always the case. In addition to hydroxylation, these enzymes catalyze a wide range of reactions, including those involving deamination, dehalogenation, desulfurization, epoxidation, pre oxygenation, and reduction. Reactions involving hydrolysis (eg, catalyzed by esterases) and ceain other non-P450-catalyzed reactions also occur in phase 1. In phase 2, the hydroxylated or other compounds produced in phase 1 are conveed by specific enzymes to various polar metabolites by conjugation with glucuronic acid, sulfate, acetate, glutathione, or ceain amino acids, or by methylation.

BONY LABYRINTH It consists of three pas: the vestibule, the semicircular canals and the cochlea. Cochlea: The bony cochlea is a coiled tube making 2.5 to 2.75 turns round a central pyramid of bone called modiolus. The base of modiolus is directed towards internal acoustic meatus and transmits vessels and nerves to the cochlea. Around the modiolus and winding spirally like the thread of a screw, is a thin plate of bone called osseous spiral lamina. It divides the bony cochlea incompletely and gives attachment to the basilar membrane. The bony bulge in the medial wall of middle ear, the promontory, is due to the basal coil of the cochlea. The bony cochlea contains three compaments: (a) Scala vestibuli, (b) Scala tympani, (c) Scala media or the membranous cochlea. The scala vestibuli and scala tympani are filled with peri- lymph and communicate with each other at the apex of cochlea through an opening called helicotrema. Scala vestibuli is closed by the footplate of stapes which separates it from the air-filled middle ear.

The reaction is catalyzed by rate-limiting enzyme of b-oxidation, carnitine acyl transferase-1: CAT-1 (or carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1), which is located on outer side (cytosolic side) of inner mitochondrial membrane or inner side of outer mitochond rial membrane QAcylcamitine is able to penetrate the inner membrane Q and is transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane by an enzyme translocase (camitine-acylcamitine translocase). Entry of acylcamitine is coupled with exit of carnitine.Once inside the mitochondrial matrix, acyl group of acylcamitine is transferred back to CoA by the enzyme carnitine acyl transferase-11: CAT-11 (or carnitine palmitoyl transferase-11) located on the inside of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Acyl-CoAis reformed in mitochondrial matrix with liberation of carnitine which is returned to the cytosalic side by the translocase (camitine-acylcamitine translocase) in exchange for an incoming acylcamitine.\nThe answer is C ."

This is called purging. Purging might be done byMaking yourself throw up Taking laxative - pills or liquids that speed up the movement of foodExercising a lotEating very little or not at allTaking water pills to urinateDiagnosisAccording to the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM - IVTR) published by the American psychological association the criteria for diagnosing a patient with bulimia areRecurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge eating is characterized by the followingEating in a fixed period of time, an amount of food that is definitely larger than most people would eat under similar circumstances.A lack of control over eating during the episode. A feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating.Recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviour to prevent weight gain such as self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxative, diuretics or other medications, fasting, excessive exercise.Self-evaluation is unduly influenced by body shape and weight.These symptoms occur at least twice a week on average and persist for at least 3 months.The disturbance does not occur exclusively during episodes of anorexia nervosa.There are two types of Bulimia Nervosa Purging typeThese patients self induce vomiting (usually by triggering the gag reflex or ingesting emetics such as syrup of ipecac) to rapidly remove food from the body before it can be digested such as diuretics and enemas.Non purging typesThese bulimics (approx. irately 6-8% of cases) exercise or fast excessively after a binge to offset the caloric intake after eating purging type bulimics may also exercise or fast but as a secondary form of weight control.The onset of bulimia nervosa is often during adolescence (b/w/3-20 years of age) with many sufferers relapsing in adulthood into episodic binging and purging even after initially successful treatment and remission.TreatmentCognitive behavioural therapy which involves teaching clients to challenge automatic thoughts and engage in behavioural experiments (e.g. in session eating of \"forbidden foods\").\nThe answer is A ."

        "output": "bcl-2 inhibits apoptosis; a (14;18) translocation resulting in overexpression of the bcl-2 protein in B lymphocytes causes apoptosis of neoplastic cells to be permanently inhibited, producing follicular lymphoma. Follicular lymphoma involves the lymph nodes and bone marrow of older people and is characterized by slow, but relentless, growth. Thus, this lymphoma allows a long survival even without any treatment. Indeed, follicular lymphoma is resistant to aggressive therapy because of its low mitotic activity. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a neoplasm of pre-B cells that affects children. Different molecular mechanisms probably account for different cases. Hyperdiploidy, the Philadelphia chromosome, t(12;21), and t(4;11) are variably found in patients with ALL. Burkitt lymphoma occurs in different clinical settings, including the African endemic, sporadic non endemic, and AIDS-associated forms. Histologically, all these forms are identical and are derived from neoplastic transformation of B cells expressing surface IgM. Common to all forms are translocations involving the c-myc oncogene (chromosome 8) and Ig loci (chromosome 14). These translocations lead to overexpression of c-myc, which encodes a nuclear transcription protein, resulting in sustained cell replication. The African form is associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection. Multiple myeloma is a neoplasm of terminally differentiated B lymphocytes that secrete large amounts of monoclonal Ig or its fragments (light or heavy chains). Approximately 25% of cases have translocations that lead to overexpression of FGFR3, a receptor for fibroblast growth factor implicated in control of cell proliferation.\nThe answer is C ."

        "output": "B. Selectively binds to rocuroniumSugammadex Morgan 5th/23lSugammadex is a novel selective relaxant-binding agentIts three-dimensional structure resembles a hollow truncated cone or doughnut with a hydrophobic cavity and a hydrophilic exterior.Hydrophobic interactions trap the drug (e.g., rocuronium) in the cyclodextrin cavity (doughnut hole), resulting in tight formation of a water-soluble guest-host complex in a 1:1 ratio. This terminates the neuromuscular blocking action and restrains the drug in extracellular fluid where it cannot interact with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.It is essentially eliminated unchanged via the kidneys.It produces rapid and effective reversal of both shallow and profound rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade in a consistent manner.* Barash 6th/Chap 20Sugammadex, previously called ORG 25969, leads to restoration of normal neuromuscular function not by interfering with acetylcholine, the nicotinic receptor or acetylcholinesterase, but by selectively binding to rocuronium, and to a lesser extent to vecuronium and pancuronium.Selective relaxant binding agent for reversal of neuromuscular blockade (NMB) induced by rocuronium or vecuronium in adults undergoing surgery\"-reference.medscape.comThe compound is a cyclodextrin, made up of eight sugars arranged in a ring to make a center to accommodate the rocuronium molecule. Once bound, rocuronium is held in place by polar side chains attached to the ring.Because sugammadex does not bind to any known receptory it is devoid of major cardiovascular or other side effects.It does not bind neuromuscular blocking drugs that do not have a steroid nucleus.The benzylisoquinolines, such as atracurium, cisatracurium and mivacurium, and succinylcholine are unaffected by sugammadex.After injection of sugammadex, evidence suggests that binding of rocuronium to sugammadex in plasma leads to a marked decrease in free (unbound) rocuronium concentration, 153 leading to the establishment of a concentration gradient of rocuronium between the neuromuscular junction and plasma. This favors movement of rocuronium from neuromuscular junction to plasma, producing less neuromuscular block. Vecuronium has less affinity for sugammadex than rocuronium does, and pancuronium has less still.Sugammadex could also be used in the case of a failed intubation. If rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg was given, sugammadex 8 mg/kg might be effective as early as 3 minutes after rocuronium injection, and if the dose of rocuronium is doubled to 1.2 mg/ kg, one might need 16 mg/kg of sugammadex. The availability of sugammadex might make succinylcholine obsolete for intubation.\nThe answer is B ."

In this condition, the difference between pupils is usually less than 1 mm.# Horner's syndrome.# Mechanical anisocoria: Occasionally previous trauma, eye surgery, or inflammation (uveitis, angle closure glaucoma) can lead to adhesions between the iris and the lens.# Adie tonic pupil: Tonic pupil is usually an isolated benign entity, presenting in young women. It may be associated with loss of deep tendon reflex (Adie's syndrome). Tonic pupil is characterized by delayed dilation of iris especially after near stimulus, segmental iris constriction, and sensitivity of pupil to a weak solution of pilocarpine.# Oculomotor nerve palsy: Ischemia, intracranial aneurysm, head trauma, and brain tumors are the most common causes of oculomotor nerve palsy in adults. In ischemic lesions of the oculomotor nerve, pupillary function is usually spared whereas in compressive lesions the pupil is involved.# Pharmacological agents will cause anisocoria, particularly if instilled in one eye. Some examples of pharmacological agents which may affect the pupils includepilocarpine, cocaine, tropicamide, MDMA, dextromethorphan, and ergolines.

        "output": "Ref Robbins 8/e p253;9/e p259 Familial (Hereditary) Amyloidosis A variety of familial forms of amyloidosis have been described; most are rare and occur in limited geographic areas. The best-characterized is an autosomal recessive condition called familial Mediterranean fever. This is a febrile disorder characterized by attacks of fever accompanied by inflammation of serosal surfaces, includ- ing peritoneum, pleura, and synol membrane. This dis- order is encountered largely in persons of Armenian, Sephardic Jewish, and Arabic origins. It is associated with widespread tissue involvement indistinguishable from reactive systemic amyloidosis. The amyloid fibril proteins are made up of AA proteins, suggesting that this form of amyloidosis is related to the recurrent bouts of inflamma- tion that characterize this disease. The gene for familial Mediterranean fever is called pyrin and encodes a protein that is a component of the inflammasome (Chapter 2). Patients have gain-of-function mutations in pyrin that result in constitutive overproduction of the pro- inflammatory cytokine IL-1 and persistent inflammation. In contrast with familial Mediterranean fever, a group of autosomal dominant familial disorders is characterized by deposition of amyloid predominantly in the peripheral and autonomic nerves. These familial amyloidotic poly- neuropathies have been described in kindreds in different pas of the world--for example, in Pougal, Japan, Sweden, and the United States. As mentioned previously, the fibrils in these familial polyneuropathies are made up of mutant forms of transthyretin (ATTRs).\nThe answer is B ."

Indications of Surgical intervention: (Ref: Bailey and Love 25/e 1145; CSDT 13/e p583; Harrison 17/e p) Age of cyst more than 12 weeks without resolution Size of cyst greater than 6 cm. Symptomatic Development of complications (eg. haemorrhage, perforation, g.i. obstruction) But note that these indications for intervention are just a generalization used for teaching the undergraduates. These are not specific indications for interventions. Therapeutic interventions are advised (irrespective of size and duration) when the pseudocyst is symptomatic or increasing is size on follow up studies, or any complication (rupture, hemorrhage, or abscess) arise or there is suspicion of malignancy. Thus expectant management is adequate (irrespective of size) if the patient is asymptomatic and serial u/s studies show that the cyst is resolving. Surgical methods Internal Drainage -- most preferred surgical management in uncomplicated pseudocyst is internal drainage. The three options are Cystojejunostomy Cystogastrostomy Cystoduodenostomy Internal drainage can be done either open surgical or laparoscopic or by percutaneous catheter-based methods (transgastric puncture and stent placement to create a cystogastrostomy) Excision of Pseudocyst - is hardly done and is usually limited to pseudocyst involving the tail of the pancreas. External drainage - is done in:- infected pseudocyst for immature pseudocyst with thin nonfibrous walls that do not allow safe internal drainage. in an unstable pt. in whom more complex surgical intervention is precluded. Transpapillary pancreatic duct stent: Because pseudocysts often communicate with the pancreatic ductal system, two newer approaches to pseudocyst management are based on main duct drainage, rather than pseudocyst drainage per se. A stent is passed into the pseudocyst through the papilla of Vater. this drainage, paicularly when incomplete, can allow bacteria to enter the pseudocyst and lead to the development of an infected pseudocyst. Another transpapillary approach involves placing a stent across the duct defect rather than into the cyst through the defect. By excluding pancreatic juice from the pseudocyst, this bridging intraductal stent may permit the duct disruption to heal and the pseudocyst to resolve without drainage (analogous to the use of common bile duct stents in the setting of a cystic duct leak).

As a result of the false perception that calcium level are low in the body, the parathyroid gland stas secreting greater amount of parathyroid hormone and renal tubule stas reabsorbing greater amount of calcium in the tubule. o Comparison of hyper parathyroidism and familial hypercalcemic hypocalciuria These two disorders have almost similar features, they differ only in the following aspect 1) Urinary renal calcium reabsorption o FHH --> > 99% of renal calcium reabsorption in the kidney (This causes decrease in urine calcium) o Hyperparathyroidism ---*< 99% of renal calcium reabsorption in the kidney (This causes increase in urine calcium) 2) Age of patient o FIIH --> Hypercalcemia is detected in affected members in first decade of life o Hyper parathyroidism --> Hypercalcemia rarely detected in patient with primary hyperparathyrcidism or MEN syndrome who are less than 20 year of age. 3) Level ofparathvroid hormone o PTH can be elevated in FHH, but the values are usually normal or lower for the same degree of calcium elevation than in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism.\nThe answer is B ."

The disease has three major features: (1) multiple neural tumors anywhere on or in the body (2) numerous pigmented cutaneous lesions (cafe au lait spots); and (3) pigmented iris hamaomas (Lisch nodules). Electron micrographic studies show that the tumors are the result of the proliferation of fibroblasts or Schwann cells in the peripheral nerves, possibly due to ras inactivation. There is no treatment, except for surgical resection of symptomatic tumors. Ependymoma can occur wherever ependymal cells are found. They are more common in children, and most often originate in the fouh ventricle. They are the most common intramedullary glioma of the spinal cord. Huntington disease, an autosomal dominant disorder, is characterized by severe degeneration of the caudate nucleus along with degenerative changes in the putamen and coex. In addition to chorea, these patients frequently suffer from athetoid movements, progressive dementia, and behavioral disorders. Marfan syndrome is due to a defect in the gene for fibrillin.

        "output": "Ans. is 'a' ie apprehension test Apprehension sign :This is a test to detect an unstable shoulder.The shoulder is abducted and externally rotated.As the examiner loads the shoulder along the long axis of the arm, the pt. becomes apprehensive, and tries to resist any further movement by using his hand or by making the shoulder stiff by muscle spasm.Some other imp, testsMe Murrays test :Test to detect meniscal injury.With the pt. lying on a couch, the surgeon stands at the side of the injured limb. He grasps the foot firmly with one hand and the knee with the other.The knee joint is completely flexed, the foot is rotated externally and the leg abducted. The joint is now slowly extended keeping the leg externally rotated and abducted.As the torn cartilage gets caught during this manoeuvre the patient will experience pain or a click may be heard and felt.A similar test with the foot internally rotated and leg adducted is carried out for lateral meniscus tears.Aplev's grinding test :Test to detect meniscal injury.The pt. lies prone on the couch. Knee is flexed to 90deg. Surgeon applies compression along the long axis of the tibia while rotating it on the femur (grinding movement).Pain during this movement indicates a meniscal tear.Pain on lateral rotation indicates a medial meniscal tear while that on medial rotation indicates a lateral meniscal tear.Sulcus test - Test to detect inferior dislocation of shoulder.Tests associated with ant, dislocation of shoulderDugas test* - Inability to touch the opposite shoulderHamilton ruler test* - Because of flattening of the shoulder It's possible to place a ruler on the lateral side of the arm. This touches the acromion and lateral condyle of the humerus simultaneously.Callway's test* - In dislocation of the shoulder vertical circumference of axilla is increased compared to normal side.Note :this type of question where a clinical method is asked is entirely new. A new question in AIIMS always indicates that these type of questions are to be expected in near future. So go through the following tests alsoBarlows test - for CDH* Ortalanis test - for CDH* Drawers test - for Cruciate ligament injury* Lachmann test - for Ant cruciate ligament injury* Ober's test - for tight ilio-tibial band* (eg in polio)Pivot shift test - for anterior cruciate ligament injury*.Thomas test - for hip flexion deformity* Trendelberg test - for unstable hip due to any reason (295 Maheshwari 2nd ed.)Cozen's test - Test to detect tennis elbow (305 Maheshwari)Painful arc test - Test to detect subacromial impingement of the rotator cuff as a cause of shoulder pain (307 Maheshwari 2nd ed.)Arm drop sign - Sign suggestive of complete tear of the rotator cuff*\nThe answer is A ."

This patient is suffering from sickle cell anemia. Most likely disorder responsible for this condition point mutation. (AIIMS November 2013 repeat)'Sickle cell anemia is an autosomal recessive disease that results from the substitution of valine from glutamic acid at position 6 of the beta-globin gene (Point mutation). - Ghai 7/e p310Point mutations within coding sequences:A point mutation may alter the code in a triplet of bases and lead to the replacement of one amino acid by another in the gene product.An excellent example of this type is the sickle mutation affecting the B-globin chain of hemoglobinQ. Here the nucleotide triplet CTC (or GAG in mRNA), which encodes glutamic acid, is changed to CAC (or GUG in mRNA), which encodes valine. This single amino acid substitution alters the physicochemical properties of hemoglobin, giving rise to sickle cell anemia.Sickle Cell DiseaseSickle cell disease is a common hereditary hemoglobinopathy that occurs primarily in individuals of African descend.Caused by a point mutation in the sixth codon of B-globin that leads to the replacement of a glutamate residue with a valine residueQ.In certain populations in Africa the prevalence of heterozygosity is as high as 30%. This high frequency probably stems from protection afforded by HbS against falciparum malariaQ.Pathogenesis:HbS molecules undergo polymerization when deoxygenated.Initially the red cell cytosol converts from a freely flowing liquid to a viscous gel as HbS aggregates form.With continued deoxygenation aggregated HbS molecules assemble into long needle-like fibers within red cells, producing a distorted sickle or holly-leaf shapeQ.Presence of HbS underlies the major pathologic manifestationsChronic hemolysisQMicrovascular occlusionsQTissue damageQMorphology:Peripheral blood demonstrates variable numbers of irreversibly sickled cells, retieulocytosis, and target cells, Howell-Jolly bodiesQ (small nuclear remnants).The bone marrow is hyperplastic as a result of a compensatory erythroid hyperplasiaQ.Expansion of the marrow leads to bone resorption and secondary new bone formation, resulting in prominent cheekbones and changes in the skull that resemble a crew-cut in x-raysQ.Increased breakdown of hemoglobin can cause pigment gallstones and hyperbilirubinemiaQ.Splenic infarction, fibrosis, and progressive shrinkage (autosplenectomy)Q\nThe answer is A ."

However, the use of these tools to cardiac imaging is severely limited because of motion aifacts produced by constantly in motion hea completing an entire cycle of contraction and relaxation in about 1 second.- So radiological cardiac imaging requires a 'window' of minimum cardiac motion to reduce motion aifacts and achieve meaningful images. The phase of minimum cardiac motion is although variable and depends on several factors especially hea rate and the chamber (i.e. right /left - atrium or ventricle) to be specifically imaged. However, the phase of minimum cardiac motion (= optimum phase for cardiac & coronary vessel imaging).\nThe answer is D ."

In most cases it lasts for 7-10 days.* PDPH is believed to result from leakage of CSF from a dural defect and decreased ICT. Loss of CSF at a rate faster that it can be produced causes traction on structure supporting the brain, particularly dura and tentorium. Traction on cranial nerve (particularly 6th nerve) produces diplopia.* Factors that increase the incidence of PDPH are young age, female sex, Pregnancy, large bore needle and multiple punctures. Timing of ambulation has no effect on incidence of PDPH* Use of small bore needle can prevent PDPH.* Intially conservative treatment is given which includes analgesics (NSAIDs), oral or i.v. fluids, Sumatriptan, cosyntropin, caffeine and recumbent position.* If conservative treatment fails, epidural blood patch can be used.

        "output": "Any tumor \"filling the 4th ventricle\" blocks the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This blockage leads to increased intracranial pressure, which manifests with nausea, vomiting, headache,nuchal rigidity, and mental status changes. If surgery is not performed promptly, cerebellar tonsillar herniation and rapid death will ensue. In children, medulloblastoma and ependymoma are the most frequent neoplasms presenting in this manner. There is no evidence in this case suggesting that acute hemorrhage into the 4th ventricular cavity has occurred, nor is medulloblastoma typically associated with this complication. CNS tumors that frequently bleed are metastases from melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and choriocarcinoma. Alterations in medullary function lead to cardiorespiratory instability and may be caused by direct tumor compression or infiltration of the medulla, neither of which is suppoed by MRI findings in this case. Infiltration of the cerebellar vermis is ceainly seen in many cases of medulloblastoma, a tumor that arises from this midline cerebellar structure.

A foreign body within the uterus provokes uterine contractility through prostaglandin release and increases the tubal peristalsis so that the feilized egg is propelled down the fallopian tube and more rapidly than in normal and it reached the uterine cavity before the development of chorionic villi and thus is unable to implant. The device in situ causes leucocytic infiltration in the endometrium. The macrophage engulf the feilized egg if it enters the endometrial tissue which inimical to the implantation of the feilized ovum Progesterone-carrying device causes alteration in the cervical mucus which prevents penetration of sperm, in addition to its local action. It also causes endometrial atrophy. It prevents ovulation in about 40% Ref: Shaw&;s textbook of Gynaecology 17th edition Pgno: 261\nThe answer is D ."

Normally the chloride content is equal in the right and left chambers of the heart (600 mg/100 ml). In fresh water drowning due to hemodilution the chloride content is decreased and in salt water drowning due to hemoconcentration the chloride content is increased in left side of heart. A 25% difference in chloride is significant but the test is of doubtful value.o Limitations of gettler test:-1. No value in atypical drowning; congenital cardiac defects as shunts and patent foramen ovale; and if drowning medium contains same amount of chloride.2. There is progressive loss of Cl- from blood after death. Therefore the test has to be made within a reasonably short time after death.\nThe answer is D ."

        "output": "C-Reactive Protein is a member of the pentraxin family of proteins named for its ability to precipitate the C-substance polysaccharide in pneumococcus. CRP was so named because it was first discovered as a substance in the serum of patients with acute inflammation that reacted with the C- (capsular) polysaccharide of pneumococcus. CAP is another name for the CRP protein. CAP stands for catabolite activator protein; CRP stands for cyclic-AMP receptor protein. This can be the answer here, but it is not given in the options. So the only related option is Capsular Polysacharide in Pneumococcus. Therefore we can select it as answer of this question.

Stage of trilaminar germ disc (third week of dev elopment)The stage of trilaminar disc formation is marked by changes during third week of development.At the beginning of third week there occurs, the most characterstic event, the gastrulation, which establishes all three germ cells, changing embryonic disc from a bilaminar to a trilaminar structure. During this period, embryo may be referred as to gastrula.Other events during this period areFormation of primitive groove.Formation of germ cells.Formation of notochord.Spread of mesoderm and formation of buccopharynyeal and cloacal membrane.Appearance of allantois.Formation of neural tube (neurulation).Development of somites.Formation of intraembryonic colon.Formation of primordial cardiovascular system.\nThe answer is B ."

These diseases are characterized by excess protein loss into the gastrointestinal tract. The diagnosis of protein-losing enteropathy is suggested by the presence of peripheral edema and low serum albumin and globulin levels in the absence of renal and hepatic disease. There should be low levels of both albumin and globulin. Selective loss of either albumin or globulin is suggestive of some other disease. Documentation of an increase in protein loss into the gastrointestinal tract has been established by the administration of one of several radiolabeled proteins and its quantitation in stool during a 24- or 48-h period.

        "output": "Changes in heavy and light chain in constant region is responsible for class and subclass of immunoglobulins Antibodies are mucoproteins that are found in the gamma (y) globulin fraction of serum on electrophoresis. Structure of antibody The basic structural unit for each class is a four chain protein with two heavy (H) and two light (L) chains. These are polypeptide chains linked together by disulfide bonds. - L chain is attached to H chain by disulfide bond - Two H chains are joind together by disulfide bond Both (H) and (L) chains are made up of two regions i.e. variable and constant region. i) H chain - One variable and 3 constant region ii) L chain - One variable and one constant region Heavy chain There are five isotypes or classes of antibodies. The isotope variation or class of antibody is due to variation in the amino acid sequence in the constant region of the heavy chain. Because there are five potential variation in the arninoacid sequence in the constant region there are five classes of antibody i.e. IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, IgE. These H chain differences are called isotypes and are designated by the greek letters gamma (y), alpha (a) mu (1.1), epsilon (e) and delta (8) respectively. Light chain All five classes or isotypes have the same amino acid sequence on the L chains. Two L chain isotypes designated kappa (lc) and lambda (X) exist for all five classes. Constant region The amino acid sequence in the constant regions of both H and L chains is similar for all antibody molecules within each class. Variable region The amino acid sequence of the variable regions on both H and L chains varies with the antigen towards which the paicular antibody is directed. Poion of the variable region which has highly variable amino acid sequence is called hypervariable region. The hypervariable regions of the H and L chains associate to form the epitope binding region known as antibody idiotype. (The pa of the antigen which binds to the antibody is called epitope). Sites on hypervariable region which make actual contact with the epitopes are called complementary determining regions (CDRS) or paratopes. The infinite range of antibody specificity of inzmunoglobulins depends on the variability of amino acid sequences at the variable unit of H and L chains. Isotype switching Isotype switching is a biological mechanism that changes a B cell's production of antibody from one class to another, for example IgM in primary response to IgG in secondary response. During this process the constant region poion of the antibody heavy chain is changed, but the variable region of the heavy chain stays the same. \"Since the variable region does not change, class switching does not effect antigen specificity\". Instead, the antibody retains affinity for the same antigen, but can interact with different effector molecules. Note No option amongst the given four is completely correct. Isotype variation is due to variations in amino-acid sequences in the constant region of carboxyterminal of heavy chains (not in both heavy and light chains).\nThe answer is C ."

All other known causes should be excluded.Nerve excitability tests are done daily or alternate days and compared with normal side to monitor nerve degeneration.Localizing the site of lesion (topodiagnosis) helps in establishing the etiology and also the site of surgical decompression of the nerve, if that becomes necessary. Treatment:General:ReassuranceRelief of pain by analgesicsCare of the eyePhysiotherapy or massage of the facial muscles gives psychological support to the patient Medical:Steroids:Prednisone is the drug of choice.If the patient presents within 1 week, the adult dose of prednisone is 1 mg/kg/day divided in morning and evening doses for 5 days.Patient is seen on 5th day, if paralysis is incomplete or recovering, dose is tapered over next 5 days.If paralysis is remains complete, the same dose is continued for another 10 days and thereafter tapered in next 5 days (total of 20 days).Surgical Treatment:Nerve decompression relieves pressure on the nerve fibers and improves the microcirculation of nerve.

The glossopharyngeal nerve is at risk for being cut during tonsillectomy. The ability to taste in the anterior two-thirds of the tongue is not at risk because that information is carried by the lingual nerve, below the tongue. The ability to protrude your tongue is provided by innervation from the hypoglossal nerve, which innervates all the intrinsic tongue muscles and lies below the tongue and is not a risk.

        "output": "Therapy of diabetic ketoacidosis requires more than insulin. Intravascular volume is often depleted, and initial fluids to restore volume should include isotonic saline or lactated Ringer's solution. If aerial blood pH is less than 7.1 or if severe hyperkalemia is present, bicarbonate supplementation should be used. IV fluids containing 5-10% dextrose (glucose) should be used when the serum glucose levels fall to 200-300 mg/dL, since high doses of rapidly acting insulin can cause life-threatening hypoglycemia. Additionally, the serum potassium concentration should be watched very carefully, since potassium is co transpoed into cells with glucose in the presence of insulin. It is often the case that hyperkalemia is present initially, secondary to decreased cellular uptake of potassium with decreased cellular uptake of glucose. However, this can rapidly change when insulin drives glucose (with potassium) into cells, and a life-threatening hypokalemia can develop. Supplementation with calcium is not required with insulin administration. Creatinine is a waste product, rather than a nutrient.

The common site or rupture in these cases is just above the upper sphincter; sometimes it is the lower oesophagus near the hiatus. 2. Spontaneous rupture. This usually follows vomiting and involves mostly the lower third of oesophagus. Postemetic rupture of all the layers of oesophagus is called Boerhaave syndrome. DIAGNOSIS Early diagnosis is imperative, as mediastinitis, resulting from rupture, can rapidly prove fatal. All patients complaining of pain in the neck or interscapular region, following an oesophagoscopy, should be suspected of a perforation. The features of cervical oesophageal rupture are pain, fever, difficulty to swallow and local tenderness, along with signs of surgical emphysema in the neck. The features of thoracic oesophageal rupture are pain, referred to the interscapular region, fever 102-104degF (39-40degC), signs of shock, surgical emphysema in the neck, crunching sound over the hea (Hamman's sign, because of air in the mediastinum) and pneumothorax.

The density of CSF is lower in women compared with men. Although this may affect relative baricity of local anesthetics, the clinical variation in the spread is probably unimpoant. Hence this is the best answer to choose from the above options. Other Options : Age: Higher anesthetic levels are achieved in the elderly for a given dosage of spinal anesthetic. Age-related decreases in CSF volume and the higher sensitivity of the nerve roots to local anesthetic are the possible reasons. Pregnancy: Increased intraabdominal pressure or conditions that cause engorgement of the epidural veins, decrease CSF volume and thus increase block height. This includes conditions such as pregnancy, ascites, and large abdominal tumors. Height: Within the range of \"normal-sized\" adults, patient height does not seem to affect the spread of spinal anesthesia. But extremes of height can affect the block height.\nThe answer is C ."

The past pointing will always be to the same side of target and will occur with either limb.With a cerebellar hemispheric lesion, the ipsilateral limbs will have ataxia and incoordination; past pointing occurs only with the involved arm and may be to the side of lesion or erratically to either side of the target.So,o Bilateral past-pointing - Vestibular system defect.o Unilateral past-pointing - Cerebellar hemisphere defect.\nThe answer is C ."

Chapter 149).CHOLERA - Pathogenesis# Cholera toxin, which consists of a monomeric enzymatic moiety (the A subunit) and a pentameric binding moiety (the B subunit). The B pentamer binds to GM1 ganglioside, a glycolipid on the surface of epithelial cells that serves as the toxin receptor and makes possible the delivery of the A subunit to its cytosolic target. The activated A subunit (Al) irreversibly transfers ADP-ribose from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide to its specific target protein, the GTP- binding regulatory component of adenylate cyclase. The ADP-ribosylated G protein upregulates the activity of adenylate cyclase; the result is the intracellular accumulation of high levels of cyclic AMP.# In intestinal epithelial cells, cyclic AMP inhibits the absorptive sodium transport system in villus cells and activates the secretory chloride transport system in crypt cells, and these events lead to the accumulation of sodium chloride in the intestinal lumen.# Since water moves passively to maintain osmolality, isotonic fluid accumulates in the lumen. When the volume of that fluid exceeds the capacity of the rest of the gut to resorb it, watery diarrhea results.Clinical features# After a 24- to 48-h incubation period, cholera begins with the sudden onset of painless watery diarrhea that may quickly become voluminous and is often followed shortly by vomiting.# Fever usually absent.# Acidosis can occur.# Characteristic appearance of stool: cloudy fluid with flakes of mucus, and no blood.# Clinical symptoms parallel volume contraction:- At losses of 3-5% of normal body weight, thirst develops;- at 5-8%, postural hypotension, weakness, tachycardia, and decreased skin turgor are documented; and- at >10%, oliguria, weak or absent pulses, sunken eyes (and, in infants, sunken fontanelles), wrinkled (\"washerwoman\") skin, somnolence, and coma are characteristic.Diagnosis:# Useful in culture and transport:- TcBC agar,- Cary Blair medium OR alkaline-peptone water-enrichment medium*Rx# Only the rapid and adequate replacement of fluids, electrolytes, and base is required.# Rice-based ORS is considered superior to standard ORS in the treatment of cholera.# For initial management of severely dehydrated patients, IV fluid replacement is preferable. Because profound acidosis (pH < 7.2) is common in this group, Ringer's lactate is the best choice.# Although not necessary for cure, the use of Single-dose tetracycline (2 g) or doxycycline (300 mg) is effective in adults but is not recommended for children <8 years of age.# For Children, furazolidone has been the recommended agent and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 2nd choice.# Due to cost and toxicity issues related to other drugs, erythromycin is good choice for pediatric cholera.\nThe answer is D ."

        "output": "Thyroid Hormones Increase Gene Transcription in the Cell Nucleus The thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine cause increased transcription by specific genes in the nucleus. To accomplish this, these hormones first bind directly with receptor proteins in the nucleus; these recep- tors are activated transcription factors located within the chromosomal complex, and they control the function of the gene promoters, as explained in Chapter 3. Two impoant features of thyroid hormone function in the nucleus are the following: 1. They activate the genetic mechanisms for the forma- tion of many types of intracellular proteins--probably 100 or more. Many of these are enzymes that promote enhanced intracellular metabolic activity in viually all cells of the body. 2. Once bound to the intranuclear receptors, the thyroid hormones can continue to express their control functions for days or even weeks. Hormones That Act Mainly on the Genetic Machinery of the Cell Steroid Hormones Increase Protein Synthesis Another means by which hormones act--specifically, the steroid hormones secreted by the adrenal coex, ovaries, and testes--is to cause synthesis of proteins in the target cells. These proteins then function as enzymes, transpo proteins, or structural proteins, which in turn provide other functions of the cells. The sequence of events in steroid function is essen- tially the following: 1. The steroid hormone diffuses across the cell membrane and enters the cytoplasm of the cell, where it binds with a specific receptor protein. 2. The combined receptor protein-hormone then diffuses into or is transpoed into the nucleus. 3. The combination binds at specific points on the DNA strands in the chromosomes, which activates the tran- scription process of specific genes to form mRNA. 4. The mRNA diffuses into the cytoplasm, where it pro- motes the translation process at the ribosomes to form new proteins. To give an example, aldosterone, one of the hormones secreted by the adrenal coex, enters the cytoplasm of renal tubular cells, which contain a specific receptor protein often called the mineralocoicoid receptor. Therefore, in these cells, the sequence of events cited earlier ensues. After about 45 minutes, proteins begin to appear in the renal tubular cells and promote sodium reabsorption from the tubules and potassium secretion into the tubules. Thus, the full action of the steroid hormone is characteristically delayed for at least 45 minutes--up to several hours or even days. This is in marked contrast to the almost instantaneous action of some of the peptide and amino acid-derived hormones, such as vasopressin and norepinephrine.

        "output": "Ans. D: Weight for height An indicator known as weight-for-height is used to determine whether a child is acutely malnourished or not. The child's weight is compared to the 'normal' weight for that height. Based on this information, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has developed chas known as international standards for expected growth. If a child's weight falls within the range considered normal for his/her height, the child is found to be well-nourished. If the weight is less than the international standards, the child is considered acutely malnourished or wasted. WHO has created cut-off points to indicate the severity of the malnutrition. If a child's weight-for-height is less than -2 z-scores (or standard detions) of normal children, s/he is considered to suffer from moderate acute malnutrition or wasting. If the child's weight-for-height is less than -3 z-scores (standard detions) of normal children s/he suffers from severe acute malnutrition and is considered to be severely wasted. Another measurement used to determine a child's nutritional status is the mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) measurement. Because MUAC measurements require a simple, colour-coded measuring band rather than weighing scales and height boards, they are often used during crisis situations. Useful for children between six months and five years of age, a MUAC measurement of less than 12.5 cm indicates that a child is suffering from moderate acute malnutrition. If the MUAC measurement is under 11.0 cm, however, the under-five child's life may be in danger as he or she is suffering from severe acute malnutrition. Although no anthropometric measure is a perfect marker of acute malnutrition, in the past, there has been a tendency to view W/H measures as the gold-standard anthropometric measure to diagnose acute malnutrition in emergencies. Discrepancies between MUAC and W/H have therefore been explained by MUAC being a poor indicator of nutritional status. A third way of diagnosing acute malnutrition is by testing for the presence of oedema. Oedema affects a child's appearance, giving him or her a puffy, swollen look in either lower limbs and feet or face. It can be detected by small pits or indentations remaining in the child's lower ankles or feet, after pressing lightly with the thumbs. The presence of oedema in both feet and lower legs is always considered a sign of severe acute malnutrition.\nThe answer is D ."

Post op ileus may be prolonged in the presence of hypoproteinemia or metabolic abnromality. Paralytic ileus is a state in which there is failure of transmission of peristaltic waves secondary to neuromuscular failure. The resultant stasis leads to accumulation of fluid and gas within the bowel with associated distention, vomiting, absent or diminished bowel sounds and absolute constipation. Radiological picture shows dilated gas filled bowel loops with multiple air-fluid level. The picture is similar to mechanical small bowel obstruction; the only differentiating point is presence of gas in colon and rectum in paralytic ileus. Other clinical differentiating features of paralytic ileus from mechanical small bowel obstruction are. 1) Pain - Pain is colicky in mechanical obstruction. Pain is not a feature of paralytic ileus and if present is a steady, diffuse pain. 2) Bowel sounds - Bowel sounds are hypoactive or absent in paralytic ileus in contrast to hyperactive bowel sounds in mechanical obstruction.\nThe answer is A ."

The annulus portion is always intact. Etiologyo Following etiology have been described : -Inadequately treated ASOM.ASOM causing persisteni perforation : - In most of the cases of ASOM, central perforation heals spontaneously.However, in some cases it may become permanent, i.e., persistent perforation syndrome.Presence fo focal sepsis in nose or throat (like tonsils, adenoid and sinus) causing ascending infection.Traumatic central perforation which becomes infected.Microbiologyo Pus culture in both types of aerobic and anaerobic CSOM may show multiple organ ism (PGI00).o Most commonly isolated organisms are gram negative bacilli, i.e., Pseudomonas, proteus, E.colio These organisms are not commonly found in the respiratory tract, while commonly found in the skin of external ear.Clinical featureso Profuse mucopurulant discharge which is not foul smelling, Le., non-foul smelling discharge.o Hearing loss (conductive type). If sensorineural component also occurs (i.e., mixed type), it arouses the suspicion of toxic deafness.o Sometimes, patient reports a paradoxical effect, i.e., hears better in the presence of discharge than when the ear is dry. This is due to round window shielding effect produced by discharge which helps to maintain phase differential,o There is no pain, if it occurs it is due to associated otitis externa not due to otitis media,o Since the infected area is open at both ends, discharge does not accumulate in the middle ear cavity,o Ossicular chain is mostly uninvolved, if involved only long process of incus is involved.Treatmento Treatment of choice for tubo-tympanic disease is mainly conservative'(AI94) in the form of aural toileting, suction clearing, topical & systemic antibiotics; with treatment of local cause like tonsil or adenoids,o Surgical procedure is done if there is recurring discharge or if there is deafness sufficient to cause disability.

An ideal suture material for abdominal closure should neither disappear nor lose its tensile strength until the wound has regained near-normal tensile strength.* Nonabsorbable, monofilament materials are found to be good.b) Method ofclosure* Single layer closure has lower incidence than multilayer closure* Interrupted suture is better than continuous suture.c) Drainage* Drainage directly through the wound leads to a higher incidence of burst than employing drainage through a separate (stab) incision.d) Incision* Midline & vertical incisions are more prone to burst than transverse incisions.e) Reason for initial operation* Deep wound infection is prone to cause burst abdomen.* Operations on pancreas with leakage of enzymes favours dehiscence.f) Wound complication* Hematoma, infectiong) Increased intraabdominal pressure* Ascites, distended bowel, coughing, vomitingh) General condition of the patient* Obesity, jaundice, malignant disease, hypoproteinemia and anemia predispose burst abd.\nThe answer is B ."

Pharmacologic Therapy * Benzodiazepines are useful in the treatment of hyperventilation resulting from anxiety and panic attacks. * By binding to specific receptor sites, these agents appear to potentiate the effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and to facilitate inhibitory GABA neurotransmission and the actions of other inhibitory transmitters. * Alprazolam (xanax) is indicated for treatment of anxiety and management of panic attacks. * Lorazepam (ativan) is a sedative-hypnotic of the benzodiazepine class that has a sho time to onset of effect and a relatively long half-life. ref : harrisons 21st ed\nThe answer is A ."

        "output": "NEPHROTIC SYNDROME:-. Characterised by massive proteinuria, hypoalbuminemua and edema, hyperlipidemia is often associated. Some patients show hematuria and hypeension. Heavy proteinuria( more than 1g/metre square/day) is the underlying abnormality leading to hypoalbuminemia ( serum albumin below 2.5g/dl). The resultant fall in plasma oncotic pressure leads to interstitial edema and hypovolemia. This stimulates the renin angiotensin aldosterone axis and ADH secretion that enhances sodium and water retention. Hypoalbuminemia also induces hepatic synthesis of beta lipoproteins resulting in hypercholesterolemia. Main cause of nephrotic syndrome in children is associated with minimal change disease. Other causes include amyloidosis, vasculitis, SLE, postinfectious glomerulonephritis, and hepatitis B nephropathy. Steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome:- MCNS accounts for 80% cases of nephrotic syndrome. Electron microscopy shows non specific obliteration of epithelial foot processes. Immunofluorescence studies shows deposits of occassional mesangial IgM. Lab findings- urine examination shows heavy proteinuria. Hyaline and granular casts are present. Serum albumin is low.

They are structurally complex cells that possess interdigitating foot processes (pedicels). The adjacent foot processes are separated by 20-30 rim wide filtration slits. The filtration slit or slit diaphragm maintains glomerular barrier function. They present a size selective distal diffusion barrier to the filtration of proteins and it is the cell type that is largely responsible for the synthesis of GBM components. Proteins located in the slit diaphragm control glomerular permeability. Impoant proteins have been identified in this regard - Nephrin - Podocin (impoant in structural organization of slit diaphragm) - CD2 associated protein and - Actin cytoskeleton The impoance of these proteins in maintaining glomerular permeability is demonstrated by the observation that mutations in the gene encoding them give rise to nephrotic syndrome.

It contains the vitamin pantothenic acid in the form of 4'-phosphopantetheine.# In mammals, the fatty acid synthase complex is a dimer comprising two identical monomers, each containing all seven enzyme activities of fatty acid synthase on one polypeptide chain. Initially, a priming molecule of acetyl-CoA combines with a cysteine --SH group catalyzed by acetyl transacylase.# Malonyl-CoA combines with the adjacent --SH on the 4'-phosphopantetheine of ACP of the other monomer, catalyzed by malonyl transacylase (reaction lb), to form acetyl (acyl)-malonyl enzyme.# It is liberated from the enzyme complex by the activity of a seventh enzyme in the complex, thioesterase (deacylase).# The free palmitate must be activated to acyl-CoA before it can proceed via any other metabolic pathway. Its usual fate is esterification into acylglycerols, chain elongation or desaturation, or esterification to cholesteryl ester.# In mammary gland, there is a separate thioesterase specific for acyl residues of C8, C10, or C12, which are subsequently found in milk lipids.\nThe answer is C ."

        "output": "In many patients with cerebral palsy, certain neonatal reflexes may persist long after the age at which they normally disappear. These primitive reflexes are usually modified or are progressively replaced as the subcortical dominance of the infant’s behavior is suppressed by higher centers of the maturing central nervous system. Three of the most common reactions, which a dentist should recognize, are the following:\n1. Asymmetric tonic neck reflex. If the patient’s head is suddenly turned to one side, the arm and leg on the side to which the face is turned extend and stiffen. The limbs on the opposite side flex.\n2. Tonic labyrinthine reflex. If the patient’s head suddenly falls backward while the patient is supine, the back may assume the position known as postural extension; the legs and arms straighten out, and the neck and back arch.\n3. Startle reflex. This reflex, which is frequently observed in persons with cerebral palsy, consists of sudden, involuntary, often forceful bodily movements.  This reaction is produced when the patient is surprised by stimuli, such as sudden noises or unexpected movements by other people. \nNote: \nParachute reflex appears at 6-9 months and persists throughout life.\nClinical importance: it is either absent or abnormal in spastic form of cerebral palsy.\nThe answer is D ."

When CL. perfringens is grown on a medium with the antitoxin spread on one half of the plate, colonies on the other half without the antitoxin will be surrounded by a zone of opacity. There will be no opacity around the colonies on the half of the plate with the antitoxin, due to the specific neutralisation of the alpha-toxin.\nThe answer is C ."

It is transmitted by relatively thick nerve fibers, although this is relative, because they are still microscopically thin, with a diameter of 2 to 5 thousandth of a millimeter. These nerves are called A-delta fibers. Because of their relatively thick size, these nerve fibers allow the pain stimulus to be transferred very fast (at a speed of five to 30 meter/second), hence the name. This is all to make the body withdraw immediately from the painful and harmful stimulus, in order to avoid further damage.# Slow pain, which starts immediately after the fast pain, is transmitted by very thin nerve fibers, called C-nerve fibers (their diameter is between 0.2 to 1 thousandth of a millimeter). Because of their small size, the pain impulse can only be transmitted slowly to the brain, at a speed of less than 2 meters per second. The response of the body is to hold the affected body part immobile (guarding, spasm or rigidity), so that healing can take place.\nThe answer is C ."

The Tm is higher (fluidity is low) when the constituent fatty acid chains are long and mostly saturated (without double bonds). Long chains have greater interactions among themselves, making the membrane stiffer. Saturated fatty acids have straight tails, whereas unsaturated fatty acids have kinked tails.

It is resistant to most Beta-lactamases; inhibits penicillinase producing staphylococci and some MRSA. A limiting feature of imipenem is its rapid hydrolysis by the enzyme dehydropeptidase I located on the brush border of renal tubular cells. An innovative solution to this problem is its combination with cilastatin, a reversible inhibitor of dehydropeptidase I, which has matched pharmacokinetics with imipenem (Half life of both is 1 hr) and protects it.Imipenem has propensity to induce seizures at higher doses and in predisposed patients. Diarrhoea, vomiting and skin rashes are the other side effects. Vancomycin: It is a glycopeptide antibiotic discovered in 1956 as a penicillin substitute which has assumed special significance due to efficacy against MRSA Strep. viridans, Enterococcus and Cl. difficile. It is bactericidal to gram-positive cocci, Neisseria, Clostridia and diphtheroids. However, in hospitals where it has been extensively used for surgical prophylaxis, etc., vancomycin-resistant Staph. aureus (VRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) have emerged. These nosocomial bacteria are resistant to methicillin and most other antibiotics as well. Linezolid: This is the first member of a new class of svnthetic AMAs &;Oxazolidinones&; which has become available for the treatment of resistant Gram positive coccal (aerobic and anaerobic) and bacillary infections. It is active against MRSA and some VRSA, VRE, penicillin-resistant Strep. pyogenes, Strep. viridans and Strep. pneumoniae, M.tuberculosis, Corynebacterium, Listeria, Clostridia and Bact. Fragilis. It is primarily bacteriostatic,but can exe cidal action against some streptococci, pneumococci and B. fragilis. Gram negative bacteria are not affected. Teicoplanin: It is a newer glycopeptide antibiotic which in fact is a mixture of 6 similar compounds. It is active against gram-positive bacteria only; mechanism of action and spectrum of activity is similar to vancomycin. Notable features are: * It is more active than vancomycin against enterococci, and equally active against MRSA. * Some VRE but not VRSA are susceptible to teicoplanin. * It can be injected i.m. as well; is excreted by kidney; dose needs to be reduced in renal insufficiency; has a very long tth (3--4 days). * Toxicity is less than vancomycin; adverse effects are rashes, fever, granulocytopenia and rarely hearing loss.

        "output": "Anemia of chronic disease, is a form of anemia seen in chronic infection, chronic immune activation, and malignancy. These conditions all produce massive elevation of Interleukin-6, which stimulates hepcidin production and release from the liver, which in turn reduces the iron carrier protein ferropoin so that access of iron to the circulation is reduced. Other mechanisms may also play a role, such as reduced erythropoiesis Anemia is considered when RBCs count : < 4.5 million in males < 3.9 million in females Or Hemoglobin ( Hb ) content : < 13.5 gm % in males < 11.5 gm % in females In response to inflammatory cytokines, increasingly IL-6, the liver produces increased amounts of hepcidin. Hepcidin in turn causes increased internalisation of ferropoin molecules on cell membranes which prevents release from iron stores. Inflammatory cytokines also appear to affect other impoant elements of iron metabolism, including decreasing ferropoin expression, and probably directly blunting erythropoiesis by decreasing the ability of the bone marrow to respond to erythropoietin. Before the recent discovery of hepcidin and its function in iron metabolism, anemia of chronic disease was seen as the result of a complex web of inflammatory changes. Over the last few years, however, many investigators have come to feel that hepcidin is the central actor in producing anemia of chronic inflammation. Hepcidin offers an attractive Occam's Razor (parsimonious) explanation for the condition, and more recent descriptions of human iron metabolism and hepcidin function reflect this view. In addition to effects of iron sequestration, inflammatory cytokines promote the production of white blood cells. Bone marrow produces both white blood cells and red blood cells from the same precursor stem cells. Therefore, the upregulation of white blood cells causes fewer stem cells to differentiate into red blood cells. This effect may be an impoant additional cause for the decreased erythropoiesis and red blood cell production seen in anemia of inflammation, even when erythropoietin levels are normal, and even aside from the effects of hepcidin. Nonetheless, there are other mechanisms that also contribute to the lowering of hemoglobin levels during inflammation: (i) Inflammatory cytokines suppress the proliferation of erythroid precursors in the bone marrow.;(ii) inflammatory cytokines inhibit the release of erythropoietin (EPO) from the kidney; and (iii) the survival of circulating red cells is shoened Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 845\nThe answer is D ."
